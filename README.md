# Morse interpretor using Python

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph. 

Below image shows the morse code for different alphabets, numbers and few special characters

I used Python language to create this interpreter for morse. The steps in the program are as follows:

**step-1: Creating a dictionary with all the morse code symbols.**

**step-2: Taking input from the user, depending on which we can decide, whether to convert text-to-code or code-to-text**

**step-3: Taking the text or code as an input from the user**

**step-4: Reading each and every character from the given input and displaying the related keys or values**

**step-5: Printing the output.**

To run this program on your computer:

*using jupyter notebook*: download the morse-text.ipynb file and directly run the program

*using command-prompt*: type/paste the code in any editor, and save it with .py extension. You can now run the program using command "python filename.py" in your command prompt.
